# Fish-Species using Machine Leanring 🖥️

## Summary
1. Code used: Python I used a decision tree model to predict the species of fish 🐡
   - Bream
   - Whitefish
   - Roach
   - Parkki
   - Perch
   - Pike
   - Smelt
3. Hyperparameter Tunning using param_grid dictionary to see if there was a better fit

   the species of fish.
